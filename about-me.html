    Hi, I'm Justin Jennard Jose, My Friends call me Jennard or Triple J. I am programming student from CIIT Senior High School. I used to study at St. Paul College of Bocaue during my Junior High School and transferred to CIIT Senior High School to study programming. One of the reasons why I chose the programming track is because I want to create my own game one day. I enjoy playing games in general, such as Call of Duty and Valorant. I also have other hobbies; I build Gundams and cosplay.I am very Interested in Web Development and graphics designing for the reason it is fun and needs creativity.   </strong>    </p> </div>
